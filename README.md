I want to get the most recent inflation in the US FRED series that includes information about Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers: Men's and Boys' Apparel in U.S. City Average. When you get that, get the id, realtime_start, realtime_end and title and store then as variabels. Then print all of them.
