I'm interested in all the available releases of economic data on the federal reserve and economic department (FRED). Find out how you can get me this data into a pandas dataframe.

Fine here's a hint: 

get postman, use vscode to test your python code, import pandas, google how to create a pandas dataframe, use git bash to clone->commit->push (google if you need help, this is supposed to be the hardest one because it's your first so you're on your own. no other help is gonna be offered unless i think it's above your skill level. so if i do help you, just know i'm thinking you're stupid.
