I'm interested in all the available releases of economic data on the federal reserve and economic department (FRED). Find out how you can get me this data into a pandas dataframe.

Fine here's some hints: 
1. get postman
2. use vscode to test your python code
3. import pandas
4. google how to create a pandas dataframe
5. use git bash to clone->commit->push 
6. expected to have one python file called fred.py that can run with no errors

KEY:
### google if you need help, this is supposed to be the hardest one because it's your first so you're on your own. no other help is gonna be offered unless i think it's above your skill level. so if i do help you, just know i'm thinking you're stupid.
